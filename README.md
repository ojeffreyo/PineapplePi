**1. This Pineapple-Pi is mainly aimed for games, such as the 'Super Mario' or 'Contra', but not only for games eventually. In all, this hardware platform will provide users with more posibilities, such as drones' manoeuvring.**

**2. The work will make up by two parts, software and hardware. The first version of Pineapple-Pi will choose the F1c100s or other resemble SOCs as the core processor of the hardware, not only for the ARM core processors but also RISC-V processors. In the future, maybe the Pineapple-Pi's main processor will be replaced by the FPGA and use FPGA to simulate a full functional SOC to raise the flexibility of this platform.**

**3. Our team is organized rather loosely, we will use our spare time to devote in this project.**
